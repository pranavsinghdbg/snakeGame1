# Snake Game

This project is an implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java, leveraging the Java Swing framework for the graphical user interface. In this game, players control a snake navigating through a grid, consuming food items to extend its length while avoiding collisions with its own body.

# Features

## Classic Gameplay: 
Enjoy the timeless fun of the Snake Game with intuitive controls.

## Length Increment Challenge:
Initially, players faced difficulties achieving high scores due to self-collisions resulting from the snake's length increment.
Enhanced Gameplay: To address this challenge, I introduced two enemies simultaneously. While both enemies contribute to the player's score, only one of them increases the snake's length. This modification adds an extra layer of engagement and competitiveness to the gameplay.

# Technology Stack

## Java: 
The project is developed in Java, a versatile and platform-independent programming language.

## Java Swing: 
The graphical user interface is built using Java Swing, providing a rich and interactive gaming experience.
